# Agoraphobia-Therapy-Using-Adaptive-VR-Technology
Our project uses VR technology, specifically the Oculus Quest, for treating social anxiety and phobias such as agoraphobia. By immersing patients in adaptive, interactive environments, they gradually confront fears in their own space. Combining psychotherapy and exposure therapy, this approach offers  and personalized anxiety treatment.

Features
Below are very short descriptions of the features we have in this project.

Sessions
The patient will use the system for exposure therapy sessions. These sessions can be controlled by a state machine or input from the clincian overseeing the patients' progress.

Auditorium Scenario
The auditorium scenario is a large environment with a seat count of around 700. This is a more complicated scenario.

Heart-rate & Stress Level Tracking
Heart rate and blood oxygenation levels are measured in real time and transmitted to our application via Bluetooth Low Energy. We store and send this data to the database after every session so the clinician can see the patient's reactions to stressful situations.

Movement Tracking & Voice Recording
The patient's movements are tracked as well as their audio recorded. We run a speech to text algorithm to get a comparison between their actual speech and the script they are meant to follow.

Patient/Clinician/Caretaker Web Portal
The web portal allows the patient or clincian to access their session data and review their performance. We display all of the data collected as well as the audio clip of the session.
