# Agoraphobia-Therapy-Using-Adaptive-VR-Technology
Our project uses VR technology, specifically the Oculus Quest, for treating social anxiety and phobias such as agoraphobia. By immersing patients in adaptive, interactive environments, they gradually confront fears in their own space. Combining psychotherapy and exposure therapy, this approach offers  and personalized anxiety treatment.
